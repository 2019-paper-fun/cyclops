		    LMP7701 SPICE MODEL PERFORMANCE

	MODEL FEATURES INCLUDE OUTPUT SWING, OUTPUT CURRENT THRU
	THE SUPPLY RAILS, GAIN AND PHASE, SLEW RATE, COMMON MODE
	REJECTION WITH FREQUENCY EFFECTS, POWER SUPPLY REJECTION
	WITH FREQUENCY EFFECTS, INPUT VOLTAGE NOISE WITH 1/F,
	INPUT CURRENT NOISE WITH F^2, QUIESCENT	CURRENT AND CHANGE
	WITH SUPPLY VOLTAGE AND TEMPERATURE, INPUT OFFSET VOLTAGE
	CHANGE NEAR THE POSITIVE RAIL, INPUT BIAS CURRENT, INPUT
	BIAS CURRENT VARIANCE WITH COMMON MODE VOLTAGE INCLUDING
	A STEEPER SLOPE BEYOND THE RAILS, AND INPUT AND OUTPUT
	CLAMP DIODES.THE MODEL HAS TWO INPUT STAGES FOR 300MV
	BEYOND THE RAIL OPERATION AND A RAIL TO RAIL OUTPUT STAGE
	THAT INCLUDES BODE CHANGES WITH LOAD, CLASS AB BIAS, AND
	ABILITY TO DRIVE LARGE CLOADS.

	MODEL TEMP RANGE IS -55 TO +125 DEG C.

	NOTE THAT THE MODEL IS FUNCTIONAL OVER THIS RANGE BUT NOT
	ALL PARAMETERS TRACK THOSE OF THE REAL PART.

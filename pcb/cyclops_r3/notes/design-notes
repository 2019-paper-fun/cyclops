1. Power for the DLD101 should come from an LM317 that recieved a 12V input and regulates that down to Vcc = 10 v

+ The LM317 has built in current protection and allows you to remove the current limit network from the design


2. The onboard DAC needs to have pretty fast max sample and voltage slew rates to keep up with the LED. I want something with 1-3 usec rise times.

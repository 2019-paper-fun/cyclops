1. Power for the DLD101 should come from an LM317 that recieved a 12V input and regulates that down to Vcc = 10 v

+ The LM317 has built in current protection and allows you to remove the current limit network from the design

2. The onboard DAC needs to have pretty fast max sample and voltage slew rates to keep up with the LED. I want something with 1-3 usec rise times.

3. I'm not quite sure how to deal with reverse polarity at the V_REF input. Can I just put a buffer stage using one of the LM324's opamps that will null any negative inputs, or does this chip behave badly when its pins are taken below Vss?

4. The OP1177 package on the schematic should be an SOIC. Right now its MSOP.

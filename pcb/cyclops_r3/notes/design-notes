Notes while designing the Cyclops R3.0 board.

X1. Power for the DLD101 should come from an LM317 that recieved a 12V input and regulates that down to Vcc = 10 v

EDIT: 	> The LM317 has built in current protection and allows you to remove the current limit network from the design
		> Switched it to +15V in regulated to +12V supply rail.

X2. The onboard DAC needs to have pretty fast max sample and voltage slew rates to keep up with the LED. I want something with 1-3 usec rise times.

EDIT: 	> Alternatives with this speed were many times more expensive. Not worth it. 
		> If the user wants mega fast rising edges, they can pipe that in through the VINPUT pin.

X3. I'm not quite sure how to deal with reverse polarity at the V_REF input. Can I just put a buffer stage using one of the LM324's opamps that will null any negative inputs, or does this chip behave badly when its pins are taken below Vss?

EDIT: 	> Fixed using a two schottky diodes. 
		> One with anode to input, cathode to +12V: This means that when the input exceeds 12.3V, the diode will clamp the input signal. 
		> One with cathode to input, anode to GND: This means that when the input goes below -0.3V, the diode will clamp the input signal.

X4. The OP1177 package on the schematic should be an SOIC. Right now its MSOP.

EDIT: 	> Why?

5. I need to run/fix an ERC on the schematic before doing anything else to the layout.

6. The values of the gate and bias-network resistors following the gate driver will need to be tuned in order to get the bias voltage close, but not over, the NMOS voltage threshold.

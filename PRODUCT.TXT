repository is granted in accordance with the CERN OHL v.1.2, available in the
top level licenses folder. The licensed (Jonathan P. Newman) requests a good
faith effort on the part of licensees who sell products based upon cyclops
hardware documentation to comply with the following actions.

1. Inform the licensor (Jonathan P. Newman) via email of information about the
type, quantity and dates of production of Products the Licensee has (had)
manufactured and will sell.  (see section 4.1 of the CERN OHL v.1.2)
 
2. Include the following text, in physical form, along with the shipment of
products to end users:

Dear Cyclops User,

Profits from the sale of Cyclops kits go to funding the Open Ephys non-profit
organization. Since I receive no monetary compensation from the sale of these
devices, it would mean a lot to me if you would consider referencing the
following paper (for which the Cyclops was developed) in published work that
makes use of the device:

J.P. Newman, et al. Optogenetic feedback control of neural activity. eLife
(4:e07192) 2015. doi: 10.7554/eLife.07192

For instance, in your methods section:

"Optical stimuli were delivered using the open-source Cyclops LED driver
(Newman et al., 2015; www.github.com/jonnew/Cyclops)."

Pull requests and issue submissions are welcome on the github repo
(https://github.com/jonnew/cyclops) and open ephys forum
(https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-ephys). If you have criticisms,
fixes, suggestions for improvement in the docs etc, please let us know so we
can implement them ASAP.

Happy stimulating.

Jon Newman MWL@MIT

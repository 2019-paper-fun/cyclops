Cyclops LED Driver
===========
Precision, wide-bandwidth current source, with optional optical feedback mode, for driving high power LEDs

# More information
Cyclops is part of the [Open Ephys](http://www.open-ephys.org/) initiative. Basic specifications for the latest revision can be found on the [Open Ephys website](http://www.open-ephys.org/cyclops/). Documentation and usage information maintained as part of this repository in [DOC.markdown](DOC.markdown). If you have questions concerning usage, performance, etc., please direct them toward the [Open Ephys forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-ephys).

# TODO
- [ ] Get [DOC.markdown](DOC.markdown) in working order.
- [ ] Get the board on CircuitHub
- [ ] Get the device on the Open Ephys store
- [ ] Create an fiber coupled LED interface with integrated optical power measurments
  - [In progress](https://github.com/jonnew/cyclops/tree/master/photodiode)
- [ ] Revision 4.0
  - High side current sense
  - Arduino gets replaced with a [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html).

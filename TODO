R3.3 Board

1. Move the banana jacks medial a touch to avoid hitting the enclosure when PCB is mounted on the middle rung.
	+ Moved both banana jacks inward 0.075"
	+ Also moved LED_PD connector inward 0.05"
	
2. Move the DAC/VCTL switch forward a touch so it is in line with the extent of the potentiometer knob.
	+ Moved forward 0.025" since that is all the solder lug through hole connectors would allow.
	
3. CS1-4 are labelled backwards.
	+ Fixed.

4. Put labels on the SPI (ICSP) connector.  
	+ Fixed.

5. Trade out front panel pot for one with switch.
	+ Instead, I just switched the DAC/VCTL switch to have a middle, disable position

6. The point of the OC protect circuit should be to deal with _mean_ overcurrent conditions. This means that the time constant of the filter in front of the analog current measurement pin should be on the order of 1 second.
	+ Changed to 100 msec as compromise.
	
7. Add back panel cutouts for USB.
	+ Done.

8. Move pcb mount plane down one level in enclosure.
	+ Done.

9. Add a logic level converter to the trig input. This will allow the use of the arduino zero when it comes out.
	+ Done.
	
10. Switching to the LT2052 was good because it allows the LED to turn fully off when the input signal is grounded. Its bad because it introduces small anomalies in the rising edge of the current/light waveform for large pulses from the off state. Can I find something that has really low input offset, is pretty fast, has RRIO, can handle the rails provided, and maybe, can allow the circuit to operate of of a single supply rail?

	+ LMP7709? 
		- This is an decompensated amplifier
		- Works very well for the optical/current FB loop, but the follower configs are unstable
		- Use a single channel version for the optical loop and compensated amps for everything else.

11. The negative rail is not needed if you use a  low drift, precision amplifier that is RRO to ground. If this is the solution, then get rid of it, and use a simple barrel connector so people don't have to use a lab supply.

12. Front panel holes are all too big, make their tolerances tighter.

13. Add on/off switch.

X14. Simulate the usage of a class AB amplifier (diodes in series with base drive on totem pole) to decrease dead time during pulses.

	+ Using a class A+AB amplifier really improves things. Response is very fast, reduced quiescent current compared to strait AB with diodes. Its been incorporated into r3.5.

15. The negative supply will be nessesary because even RRIO amps can only approach the rails, they generally cannot go to them. This is true for the LMP7707, which I will be using for the gate drive circuit. Therefore, I need to generate a small negative supply.
	
	+ Either a inverting switching regulator or a switched cap voltage inverter followed by a linear regulator.
	+ The OE ac. board has a good example of this.

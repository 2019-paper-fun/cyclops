R3.3 Board

1. Move the banana jacks medial a touch to avoid hitting the enclosure when PCB is mounted on the middle rung.
	+ Moved both banana jacks inward 0.075"
	+ Also moved LED_PD connector inward 0.05"
	
2. Move the DAC/VCTL switch forward a touch so it is in line with the extent of the potentiometer knob.
	+ Moved forward 0.025" since that is all the solder lug through hole connectors would allow.
	
3. CS1-4 are labeled backwards.
	+ Fixed.

4. Put labels on the SPI (ICSP) connector.  
	+ Fixed.

5. Trade out front panel pot for one with switch.

6. The point of the OC protect circuit should be to deal with _mean_ overcurrent conditions. This means that the time constant of the filter in front of the analog current measurement pin should be on the order of 1 second.
	+ Changed to 100 msec as compromise.

The creation of commercial products using the hardware documentation in this
repository is granted in accordance with the CERN OHL v.1.2, available in the
top level licenses folder. The Licensor (Jonathan P. Newman) requests a good
faith effort on the part of Licensees who sell products based upon the
hardware documentation within this repository to comply with the following 
actions:

1. Inform the licensor (Jonathan P. Newman) via email of information about the
type, quantity and dates of production of Products the Licensee has (had)
manufactured and will sell (see section 4.1 of the CERN OHL v.1.2).
 
2. Include the following text, printed in physical form, along with the shipment 
of products to end users:

Dear Cyclops User,

I am very happy that this device may enable your scientific endeavors and I'm 
sincerely grateful for your interest in the project. In general, I hope this 
project will eventually be one small module in a of growing set of high-quality, 
open-source, and afforable tools that facilitate your research and enable an open, 
community-oriented approach to science. Since I receive no monetary compensation 
from the sale of these devices, it would mean a lot to me if you would consider 
referencing the following paper (for which the Cyclops was developed) in 
published work that makes use of the device:

J.P. Newman, et al. Optogenetic feedback control of neural activity. eLife
(4:e07192) 2015. doi: 10.7554/eLife.07192

For instance, in your methods section:

"Optical stimuli were delivered using the open-source Cyclops LED driver
(Newman et al., 2015; www.github.com/jonnew/Cyclops)."

Pull requests and issue submissions are welcome on the github repo
(https://github.com/jonnew/cyclops) and open ephys forum
(https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-ephys). If you have criticisms,
fixes, suggestions for improvement in the docs etc, please let us know so we
can implement them ASAP.

Happy stimulating.

Jon Newman MWL@MIT

### Cyclops Bill of Materials

1. This google sheet contains a reasonably up-to-date parts list. However, it is manually managed and therefore prone to errors. It is recommended that method 2 be used instead

2. Fully assembled cyclops PCBs can be purchased from circuithub

This also includes an up-to-date parts list for each PCB with optimized prices. Note that these parts are for a single PCB without the enclosure, power supply, etc. Those parts can be found on the "Circuit Hub Kit" tab of the Google spreadsheet above.

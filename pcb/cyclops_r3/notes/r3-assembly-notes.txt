1. The ADR03 package specified in the BOM does not match the footprint on the board.

	+ If you have an option, use the standard SOT-3-2 specified in the BOM because the lead pitch is larger.

2.DAC switch is mislabeled. When the switch is closest to the middle of the board is when DAC is selected.

X3. There is a big wiring error connecting +12V to LED-. It is just a leftover trace from an earlier version that was not caught by DRC because there were numereous intentional infractions in this area. Just remove that trace completely.

4. Board temp circuit does not seem to work.I see no change in the VTemp as the pcb temperature rises

5. The comparitor circuit is always in kill mode and this does not turn off the P channel FET for some reason. 

	+ This is puzzling because I thoroughly breadboarded this part of the circuit
	+ The comparitor is providing about 7 V to the gate of the FET (which by my calculations it should not be), so that this one problem
	+ The other problem is that with 7 volts at the gate, the FET should be off, which it does not seem to be. 
	+ I need to re-breadboard this circuit to figure out what the heck is going on

6. The N-FET that souces to the LED and, probably (I don't have this on my board to see for sure), the photodiode power jack might are too close the barrel jack on the Arduino and therefore you can't push the sheild down the whole way.

7. It would be good to have a third daughter board for aumatic heatsink LED alignment and to provide a mounting bracket for the photodiod and fiber.
